# Youtube-like Prediction using PySpark

This project uses PySpark to predict the number of likes a Youtube video will receive based on its features. The project utilizes a dataset of Youtube video data and applies various machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:
- PySpark
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alihaider-ai/Youtube-like-prediction-using-Pyspark.git`
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file: `jupyter notebook YoutubeReg.ipynb`

## Results

The machine learning algorithms used in this project include Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The results of each algorithm were evaluated using mean squared error. The results are visualized in the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Conclusion

This project provides a proof-of-concept for using PySpark and machine learning algorithms to predict the number of likes a Youtube video will receive. The results demonstrate the potential of these algorithms for predicting video popularity and the code can be modified and expanded to further improve the prediction system.
